Below is a **professional, execution-grade DAILY WORKSHEET** that converts your 6-month weekly roadmap into **clear day-by-day targets**, written from the perspective of how a **working quantitative developer** would plan and track progress.

This is designed to be **directly Excel-ready** (one row = one day), with **explicit deliverables**, **resources**, and a **mandatory end-of-day summary** so you always know whether the day was successful or not.

---

### Next Step

If you want, I can:

1. Convert this into **downloadable Excel**
2. Create **Day 1–Day 30 fully expanded row-by-row**
3. Start **C++ quant interview coding practice immediately**

Tell me which one to execute next.
